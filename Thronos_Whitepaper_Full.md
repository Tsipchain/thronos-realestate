# Thronos Chain & THR Token - Complete Whitepaper

## Version 2026.1 | Thronos Network V3.6: The Survival Blueprint

---

## Introduction

Thronos Chain is a next-generation, SHA256-based blockchain project focused on survivability, decentralization, and freedom. It merges the core values of Bitcoin with innovative data transport technologies and fully offline, censorship-resistant communication.

Thronos V3.6 represents a paradigm shift: a blockchain that operates not only on the internet, but through sound, radio waves, images, and light. A network designed to survive grid collapse, censorship, and infrastructure failure.

## Technical Characteristics

- **Algorithm**: SHA256 (Bitcoin-compatible)
- **Compatibility**: Works with existing ASIC miners (Antminers, Block Erupters)
- **Transaction Speed**: Instant finality through asynchronous node syncing
- **Fees**: Ultra-low fees comparable to XRP
- **Smart Signing**: TXs are signed and distributed via multiple real-world mediums (images, audio, QR, radio)
- **Max Supply**: 21,000,001 THR (1 more than BTC)
- **Halving**: Every 4 years (Bitcoin-compatible)
- **Peg**: 1 THR = 0.0001 BTC (Soft Peg maintained via Watcher Service)

## 2. Survival Mode: Communication Without Internet (Audio-Fi)

Thronos V3.6 introduces data transmission via Audio (Audio-Fi):

1. **Encoding**: Transaction (JSON) is converted to QR Code
2. **Modulation**: QR is converted to WAV file (via FSK modulation)
3. **Transmission**: Audio is broadcast via wireless, Peiko X9, or LoRa
4. **Decoding**: The Ryzen 7 AI node "listens" to the audio, cleans it via AI noise reduction, and executes the transaction offline

### WhisperNote Protocol
- Transaction data encoded as frequency-shifted audio tones
- Selectable frequencies: 1kHz, 2kHz, 4kHz
- Web Audio API generation for browser-based transmission
- WAV download capability for offline transfer

### RadioNode

## 3. Off-Grid Operation (Solar Energy)

Full system autonomy through photovoltaic integration:

**Solar Controller (Victron/RS485)** sends battery data to the G1 node.

### Energy-Aware Operating Modes:

| Mode | Battery Level | Active Services |
|:-----|:-------------|:----------------|
| **Full Mode** | >80% | CPU Mining, ASIC Validation, Full API, AI Inference |
| **Eco Mode** | 30-80% | VerifyID only, AI Inference, Reduced API |
