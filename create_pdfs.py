    # Add a font that supports unicode if possible, but standard FPDF is limited.
    # We will use a standard font and replace incompatible characters if necessary
    # or try to use a font that supports Greek if available.
    # Since we might not have a Greek font file handy, we might have issues with Greek characters.
    # Strategy: Try to find a TTF font or fallback to latin-1 and transliterate/ignore errors?
    # Better Strategy: Use a font included in the system or download one?
    # For this environment, let's try to use a standard font and handle encoding carefully.
    # If the text is in Greek, standard FPDF 'Arial' won't work well without a specific encoding/font.
    # Let's check if we can use a DejaVu font or similar if present.
    
    # Minimal approach: Use a font that supports UTF-8 if we can load it.
    # If not, we might need to strip non-latin characters or use a specific encoding.
    # Given the user requirement involves Greek text (from previous context), this is critical.
    
    # Let's try to use 'Arial' with 'utf-8' encoding support in FPDF2 if available, 
    # or add a Unicode font.
    
    # Since I cannot easily download a font file here, I will try to use a standard font 
    # and hope the environment has a font that supports it, or I will write the text 
    # in a way that preserves it (e.g. simple transliteration if needed, but user wants Greek).
    
    # WAIT: The prompt environment might not have custom fonts.
    # I will attempt to use a standard font. If it fails for Greek, I will log it.

                # This is a risk.

                # Let's try to encode to latin-1 with replacement to avoid crash, 
                # but this ruins Greek text.
                # We need a font. I will try to look for a font file in common locations?

                # Let's try to write the text. If it's Greek, standard FPDF will fail.
