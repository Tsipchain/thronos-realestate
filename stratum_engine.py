stratum_engine.py
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A very simple Stratum job server for ThronosChain.  This engine accepts
incoming TCP connections from SHA‑256 miners on port 3334 and exchanges
minimal Stratum protocol messages.  It is intended as a **placeholder** to
enable miners (such as cgminer, bfgminer or USB sticks) to connect during
development.  The server currently issues a fixed job template and does not
validate shares or record work.

In a production environment, the Stratum engine would need to assemble block
templates from the local blockchain state, assign unique extranonces and
difficulty targets to connected miners, validate incoming shares against the
current target and credit miners with rewards.  This demonstration server
provides only the handshake and a static job for illustrative purposes.
